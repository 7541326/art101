			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to fetch data from XKCD's API and output specific parts of the returned JSON into specific parts of the HTML page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I wasn't able to pull from XKCD's API at first,my code seemed all correct, but it would return an error every time. Looking it up, it seemed that there was some sort of property that wasn't set on the server side that wasn't letting me pull from the API, I didn't really understand? However, my lab partner figured out a way to get around it by doing something to the link, which I don't really understand, but it works?</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I'm pretty busy around this time of the quarter, so I wasn't really able to spend a whole lot of time on this outside of getting it to work and the bonus task and such.</p>
