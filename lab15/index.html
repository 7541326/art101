			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to fetch data from an API using jQuery's AJAX call, and then output the result into the page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This is the first time I've used jQuery's AJAX or anything like it, so it was hard to get a hang of at first, but I was able to figure it out. Mostly, I struggled with getting the correct values from the JSON fetched from the API, especially because the Pokemon API has a ton of info in the JSON it returns. I also encountered a problem when trying to set up the random generator, because in the API, the id ranges are 0-1025, and then 10001-10277 for, I think, variants of the normal pokemon. I struggled a lot trying to merge these two ranges into a single button before giving up and just making them two separate buttons. Also, because the output div is at the bottom of my page, whenever the content of the div was replaced, it scrolled back up a bit, which didn't seem very useful, so I ended up having to set a min-height in the CSS.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this lab was pretty fun to work with, even though I kept encountering issues because I wasn't very clear on how APIs worked or how to grab the JSON from the API as a variable I could use in other functions - I ended up just putting all the functions that used data from the JSON in the AJAX thing. I think my code could probably use some work, and I didn't bother too much with the presentation of it since I was trying to figure out the code, but I think I'm pretty happy with it.</p>
