			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to loop a certain amount of time, using conditionals to print a different string depending on what number the current iteration is on.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I ran into was when setting the columns property on the output div, it would randomly make the first column lower than the rest. I think the p tags were doing this, but I'm not sure why exactly, so I just got rid of the p tags and added br to make each number on a new line.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I didn't really understand how to use objects in this assignment right off the bat - I didn't think to loop through things to add things to the object, so my first code with the object was very redundant (taking the value from each field and adding it to the object). I had to look at Wes Modes' site to understand how it worked, and I tried to comment the code to understand what specifically was happening with each line of code.</p>
