			<h1>Lab 10 - Javascript for the Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to create a button with an attached function, that will append a random selection of text to a selected div.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I encountered some troubles with extra task stuff, such as the input form and the timestamp things, but I was able to figure them out by Googling them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>While I was able to get the bonus task of the left/right aligned text to mimic messages, I decided against using it on the final page. I like the timestamp I put, as well as the fact that I could make it so that you can't "send" an empty message to the output div. Also able to press enter to send while the input is selected, which I think is nice. I also changed the random text generator, so that I could have it put up a randomly selected pre-defined quote, instead of a randomly sliced selection of text.</p>
