			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function in Javascript that takes user input and then does things to the received string.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I feel like the way I wrote the Javascript could be simplified somehow, but otherwise I didn't have too many difficulties following the instructions given by the assignment. If I didn't understand something, I could look it up.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was able to follow the instructions provided by the assignment, but I didn't really want to keep using writeln, so after finishing the assignment by using writeln, I switched it to innerHTML. This was mostly so that I could create a button to attach the name function to, for getting a new input and printing a new output.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<button id="getNameButton" onclick="outputStuff()">Input Name :)</button>
					<div id="output">
						<p>Click the button to get started!</p>
					</div>
