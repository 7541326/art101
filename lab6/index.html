			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this assignment was to create an array and an object in Javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This assignment was fairly straight forward. It was also a rather short assignment with only a few steps, so it wasn't too hard to do. One issue I encountered was that I didn't like how there wasn't a space in between array elements when they were output to the HTML file, but this was easy to fix with .join().</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was rather busy this week, so I didn't really do anything extra on this lab (or the last one). </p>
