			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a file structure, and then edit the main home page (HTML and CSS files).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While editing and testing files locally was pretty okay, a lot of problems arose when pushing them to Github.</p>
					<p>The links broke, I'm pretty sure since the Github page is in a folder art101/ instead of the root directory, so all my links tried to go to 7541326.github.io/lab3/index.html or whatever, omitting the art101/ that needed to be in the URL. I fixed this by including the art101 folder in my links, as well as putting my files in an additional art101 folder for them to work locally. This was only a problem because I didn't want to put links on every page every time, so I put them all on a single file and loaded that file's contents into every other page, which means the links have to work no matter which folder they're in.</p>
					<p>There's some weird consistency issues with the spacing and stuff between pages, which is weird, and I haven't figured that out yet. Probably I need to organize my CSS files better, because right now they're kind of bad.</p>
					<p>I don't know how this site looks like on any device other than my laptop, which is probably a big issue. I do know that on Chrome, the default font seems to be a serif font, which I don't enjoy, but I haven't gotten around to putting in proper fonts and such.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I love customizing things so I spent a lot of time customizing my home page. It was fun except for the part where my CSS is really bad and I just keep adding small changes to padding and stuff to make things be where I want them to be. I feel like there has to be a more elegant solution to this.</p>
