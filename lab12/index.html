			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a text field that would take user input, and then depending on how long the given string is, return one of several outcomes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I had a good amount of problems that came up when moving things around in my script, largely because I'm very bad at keeping track of what bracket is for what, even with the built-in color guide where the corresponding brackets match. I also probably could have made my code a lot cleaner than it is right now (it's bad).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I had fun with this assignment, refactoring aside (I started adding things at the same time as trying to simplifiy some of my code, which means my code just ended up getting weirder instead of better). I also didn't know how I could get the color change to transition smoothly, so it's a bit abrupt.
