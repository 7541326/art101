			<div class="minor-section" id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use functions from jQuery to create event listeners that would do something when the event is triggered.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problem">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with getting the jQuery to target things properly, though it was mostly me typing in the id selectors and such wrong.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I wanted each section to toggle a different color when pressing the button, which I couldn't figure out how to do the way I wanted when consolidating the javascript functions according to the task X. So while I've completed that task, it's not reflected in the final javascript I uploaded to Github.</p>
