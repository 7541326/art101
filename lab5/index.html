					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to define variables in Javascript and then write them into an HTML file (also using Javascript).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Using writeln or write as the instructions said would cause nothing to be added to the specified div, even when linking the script in the div as the instructions said. Apparently using these from an external script file causes them to not work (and write/writeln is not recommended for html?) so instead I used innerHTML to load in a string to the specified div.</p>
