					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to define variables in Javascript and then write them into an HTML file (also using Javascript).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Using writeln() or just write() as the instructions said would cause nothing to be added to the specified div, even when linking the script in the div as the instructions said. I did get it to work, but I don't really like using writeln().</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment went fairly well, other than the issues using write() and writeln().</p>
