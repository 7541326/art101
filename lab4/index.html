			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we took an everyday task and a simple game, and broke both down into steps to practice pseudocoding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Everyday Task Pseudocode</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Prep the natural nail bed</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Wash and dry hands</li>
						<li>Trim nails with a nail clipper to comportable length</li>	
						<li>Using a rectangular nail buffer, buff/sand nail bed</li>	
						<li>Apply nail dehydrator</li>	
						<li>Apply nail primer</li>	
						<li>Repeat with all finger nails</li>
					</ol>	
					<li>Pick out a nail shape and sizes</li>
					<li>Prepare the gelx nail extension</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Slightly buff out the gelx nails with a nail drill or buffer on the bottom side of the nails</li>
						<li>Use acetone with a brush to brush out the nails for grip</li>
						<li>Apply nail primer to the bottom</li>
						<li>Repeat with all gelx nails</li>
					</ol>	
					<li>Allow all nails to dry with primer</li>
					<li>Prepare a mini/accessible UV lamp for gluing</li>
					<li>Apply nail glue to the bottom side of the nail</li>
					<li>Place nails glue side down to natural nail bed</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Hover UV light over the nail after carefully placing with no air bubbles</li>
						<ol>
							<li>If air bubbles appear reapply with extra glue</li>
							<li>Clean off excess glue</li>
						</ol>	
						<li>Repeat with all finger nails</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Put hands in large nail lamp one at a time, 1 minute each</li>
					<li>Reshape nails to desired shape and length</li>
					<li>Prep for nail design</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Buff the nails until all gelx tip are a foggy white</li>
						<li>Clean off dust with rubbing alcohol</li>
						<li>Apply base coat gel polish to all nails</li>
						<li>Then flash under the UV lamp for at most 30 seconds</li>
					</ol>
					<li>For white pearl nails</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Apply  a milky white gel polish</li>
						<li>Flash nails under lamp for at max 30 seconds </li>
						<li>Use rubbing alcohol to remove sticky residue</li>
						<li>Using a eye shadow applicator take some pearl chrome powder and rub all over the nails</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Dust off excess powder</li>
						</ol>
						<li>Seal with top coat</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Clean off nails with rubbing alcohol </li>
					<li>Finish with cuticle oil</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Simple Game Pseudocode</h2>
				<pre><code>// Snake
// An implementation of the game
// Laura Zhou
// April 2025

// Define variables to hold score, etc.
// Draw UI on screen (a grid)
// Draw game elements on screen (snake with a starting length of 1, apple)
// Take user input
    // Upon first input, snake begins moving and does not stop 
    // Based on which button the user presses, change snake direction
// While the snake moves, make checks for conditions:
    // If the snake touches an apple:
        // Delete the apple and put another apple somewhere else (cannot be in an occupied square),
        // Add to the snake's length,
         //+1 to score variable
    // If the snake touches a wall (edge of board): 
        // Stop snake movement, 
        // Game over
    // If the snake touches another segment of the snake:
        // Stop snake movement, 
        // Game over
// On game over:
    // Update high score variable with current score,
    // Display game over screen, with current score and high score
// Take user input (start new game)
    // Clear the current score variable for a new game,
    // Reset board
        // Snake length reset to 1, 
        // Snake position and direction reset to starting position,
        // Apple deleted and replaced in starting position
// Take user input (to move snake and play another game, etc.)

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This assignment was fairly straightforward, though it was a little tough sometimes making sure we had described all the steps needed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment wasn't too hard to do, but when you break down and list out all the steps needed to do a task, it can be surprisingly a lot.</p>
